Host your application in Route53 using Load Balancer.
Pre-requisites - You need a domain name for this project. You can get cheap domain names on Hostinger, Go Daddy etc.

Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance and put the below script in the User Data option.
#!/bin/bash
yum update all
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Welcome to Linux Projects" >> /var/www/html/index.html

This will create an index.html page for your application.

Step 2: Create a Target Group and attach the above EC2 instance to the Target Group.

Step 3: Now, Create an Application load Balancer. Attach the Target group to your Load Balancer.

Step 4: Copy your Public IP address of your instance and paste it to your browser. You should see the message "Welcome to Linux Projects".
Note: Add security group to EC2 and Load Balancer to open ports ssh-22, HTTP-80, and HTTPS-443.

Step 5: Now copy your Load Balancer DNS to your browser and you shall see the message.

Step 6: Now go to Route53 and Create a Hosted Zone.
In Hosted Zone specify your Domain Name. Type - Public Hosted Zone. Now you shall see 2 records created by default in that Hosted Zone.
Create another record: Record Type - A. Click on Alias. Select Endpoint as Application Load Balancer and your LB Region and then your Load Balancer DNS name.
Make sure that Routing Policy is Simple Routing.
Then Create Record.

Step 7: In your Records look for a Record with Type: NS.
Copy the "Value/Route Traffic to" values and Paste to your Domain Account Nameservers.
eg. In Hostinger account select your Domain name and paste the copied values from record and paste to your Domains Nameservers.
Note: There are 4 Nameservers that you need to copy.

Step 8: Go to your browser and type your domain name. eg. example.com
You shall see the message we wrote in index.html file.
